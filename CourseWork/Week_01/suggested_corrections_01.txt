If and when there is a need to use my name, please use it as just

  Dr. Gowtham

as indicated in the syllabus and course material, and NOT as anything else
(e.g., what you have used in references).


General remarks (-0.50%):
Fix the typographical and grammatical errors, missing citations, and use the 
appropriate LaTeX syntax while typesetting the solutions. The assignment 
contains file(s) that ought not to be there. This is an indication that you 
are not following the guidelines given in Tips and/or the end of the assignment. 
Problem #5 (-0.25%):
Good comments. What was the need to run this program to 10 iterations if it 
gave the desired error after two iterations?
