General remarks:

  Needs spell check and removal of unnecessary capitalization of words

  Stop by and I can offer few tips to improve your next submission
  
Problem  #4, Part #2 (-1.00%)

  Sum approach does not take into account the required error/tolerance but
  uses a 'for' loop

  Limit approach: we had discussed, during Journal of Failed experiments topic, 
  that applying limit in computational problems (at least in this course) would 
  imply direct application of given values AND not using the built-in 'limit' 
  functions.

Problem #5 (-0.50%)

  Gnuplot graph for single coin flips is incorrect (is not plotted to the
  given guidelines)
