## Training Camp

  01. Follow the numerical sequence of training camps, and the sequence of
      problems/tasks therein. Each problem usually tends to build upon 
      results (from a previous problem). Each training camp should take
      2-3 hours to complete.

      There is no due date by which these need to be completed. However, 
      doing so before the beginning of Fall instruction will help you get
      bootstrapped (i.e., *lacing up the shoes before beginning the journey*), 
      and in turn, make a better use of time and opportunities.

  02. Replace ```john``` with your ISO username, and
      **John Sanderson** with your real/full name. ISO credentials
      refer to your Michigan Tech ISO username and password  (i.e., the
      ones you use to log into Banweb or Canvas or Michigan Tech Gmail).

  03. Keeping detailed handwritten notes is a very good habit to 
      develop/maintain. It can save time and frustration when things go wrong. 
      Saving meaningfully named electronic screenshots of workflows (commands 
      and their output) is another very useful habit. 

      Notes should include date and time, location (building, floor and 
      room #), and the hostname of the worstation being used. External help,
      from instructor or anyone else, will be very limited in their absence.

  04. Set yourself up with a reliable data backup scheme, and use it.

  05. Acknowledging that you need help and asking for it when necessary is
      not a sign of weakness. Be sure to appropriately cite the source of 
      any such help.
