\section*{Guidelines}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Do not edit this file directly as it might be periodically
        overwritten with changes. Copy \gfilename{Description.tex} as 
        \gfilename{Description\_\$\{USER\}.tex}, and edit the latter.
  \item Refer to \textsf{Tips} section in the course material for step by
        step instructions to compile \gfilename{Description\_\$\{USER\}.tex}, 
        and commit \gfilename{Description\_\$\{USER\}.*} to the GitHub 
        repository.
  \item Keep your research advisor happy by making timely and meaningful
        progress. He/She controls the score for this project, worth 20\% of 
        the final grade.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting \cite{WC1953}
industry. It has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
when an unknown printer took \cite{TikZPGF, PlanetMath} a galley of type and 
scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived five centuries, the 
leap into electronic typesetting, and remained essentially unchanged. 

% Description -- no more than two paragraphs; 
% no more than 5-6 sentences per paragraph

\textsl{Describe what you are going to do and how you are going to do it?
This can be technical, and intended for someone in your area of research.
Include any mathematics, graphics, and preliminary work that has already been 
done (either by you or someone else). \textcolor{OrangeRed}{No more than
five references, and must not exceed three paragraphs with five-six sentences 
per paragraph.}}

It is a long established fact \cite{GN2006, EPR1935} that a reader will be 
distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The 
point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution 
of letters, as opposed to using \textsl{Content here, content here}, making it 
look like readable English. A search for \textsl{lorem ipsum} will uncover 
many web sites in their infancy. A search for \textsl{lorem ipsum} will uncover

\newpage
There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the
majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or
randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to
use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything
embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on
the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the
first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin
words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem
Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always
free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
