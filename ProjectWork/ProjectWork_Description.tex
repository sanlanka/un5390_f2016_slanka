Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting \cite{WC1953}
industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever 
since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled 
it to make a type specimen book \cite{TikZPGF}. It has survived not only five 
centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
unchanged. It was popularized in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets 
containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing 
software \cite{PlanetMath}.

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Description}

\textsl{Describe what you are going to do and how you are going to do it?
This can be technical, and intended for someone in your area of research.
This section can include any mathematics, graphics, and preliminary work
that has already been done (either by you or someone else). No more than
five references, and must not exceed three paragraphs with five-six sentences 
per paragraph.}

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random 
text \cite{GN2006, EPR1935}. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin 
literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, 
a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of 
the more obscure Latin words, \textsl{consectetur}, from a Lorem Ipsum 
passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, 
discovered the undoubtable source \cite{WC1953}.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Do not edit this file directly as it might be periodically
        overwritten with changes.        
  \item Copy \texttt{ProjectWork\_Description.tex} as
        \texttt{ProjectWork\_john.tex} (where \texttt{john} is your 
        Michigan Tech ISO username).

        Edit \texttt{ProjectWork\_john.tex}.
  \item Keep your research advisor happy by making timely progress. He/She
        controls the score for this project, worth 25\% of the final grade.
  \item Turn in weekly status report, using the provided 
        \texttt{ProjectWork\_StatusReport.tex} as template before 4:59 pm on
