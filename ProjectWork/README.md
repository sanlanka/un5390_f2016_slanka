## Term project

Project work begins in week #10 and continues through the end of semester.
If you have a research advisor and a project, you may (and very highly
encouraged to) treat it as the term project in this course. If you do not
have a research advisor, contact the instructor by week #08 so that
appropriate arrangements can be made.

Status reports are due before 11:59 pm on every Friday starting week #10.
