\begin{enumerate}
  \item Do not edit this file directly as it might be periodically
        overwritten with changes. Copy \gfilename{Status.tex} as 
        \gfilename{Status\_\$\{USER\}.tex}, and edit the latter. These weekly
        reports may then be used to prepare the project report, iff your
        advisor requires it.
  \item Refer to \textsf{Tips} section in the course material for step by
        step instructions to compile \gfilename{Status\_\$\{USER\}.tex}, 
        and commit \gfilename{Status\_\$\{USER\}.*} to the GitHub repository.
  \item Commit \gfilename{Status\_\$\{USER\}.*} to the GitHub repository 
        before 4:59 pm on Friday starting week \#10. Each such status report 
        is worth 1\% of the final grade.
