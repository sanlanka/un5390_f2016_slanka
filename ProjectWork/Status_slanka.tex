%\begin{enumerate}
%  \item Do not edit this file directly as it might be periodically
%        overwritten with changes. Copy \gfilename{Status.tex} as 
%        \gfilename{Status\_\$\{USER\}.tex}, and edit the latter. These weekly
%        reports may then be used to prepare the project report, iff your
%        advisor requires it.
%  \item Refer to \textsf{Tips} section in the course material for step by
%        step instructions to compile \gfilename{Status\_\$\{USER\}.tex}, 
%        and commit \gfilename{Status\_\$\{USER\}.*} to the GitHub repository.
%  \item Commit \gfilename{Status\_\$\{USER\}.*} to the GitHub repository 
%        before 4:59 pm on Friday starting week \#10. Each such status report 
%        is worth 1\% of the final grade.

Yes. I did meet Dr.Gowtham from 11 to 11:10 AM ,November 2.
          \vfill

    \item What did you do this week (past Saturday through this Friday)? 
\\
Discussed about the potential project ideas with Dr.Gowtham. Chose the ``Apollo 16 on HPC"
as my term project. Studied about the gravity slingshot technique. Working on the workflow as expected in the project Description.          
\vfill

    \item What are you planning on doing next week (this Saturday through next Friday)? 
\\
To work on the project workflow and getting the equations set up and tested starting from Newton's law of Gravitation.
       
   \vfill

    \item What were (are) the difficulties/obstacles you faced (facing)?
\\
The main difficulty is coming up with a good workflow and setting up the equations as of now.         
\vfill

    \item What is the approximate percentage progress?
\\ 5\%
