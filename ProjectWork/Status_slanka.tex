%\begin{enumerate}
%  \item Do not edit this file directly as it might be periodically
%        overwritten with changes. Copy \gfilename{Status.tex} as 
%        \gfilename{Status\_\$\{USER\}.tex}, and edit the latter. These weekly
%        reports may then be used to prepare the project report, iff your
%        advisor requires it.
%  \item Refer to \textsf{Tips} section in the course material for step by
%        step instructions to compile \gfilename{Status\_\$\{USER\}.tex}, 
%        and commit \gfilename{Status\_\$\{USER\}.*} to the GitHub repository.
%  \item Commit \gfilename{Status\_\$\{USER\}.*} to the GitHub repository 
%        before 4:59 pm on Friday starting week \#10. Each such status report 
%        is worth 1\% of the final grade.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Did you meet with your advisor(s) to discuss research this week?
\\        
Yes. I did meet Dr.Gowtham from 11 to 11:10 AM ,November 2.
          \vfill

    \item What did you do this week (past Saturday through this Friday)? 
\\
Discussed about the potential project ideas with Dr.Gowtham. Chose the ``Apollo 16 on HPC"
as my term project. Studied about the gravity slingshot technique. Working on the workflow as expected in the project Description.          
\vfill

    \item What are you planning on doing next week (this Saturday through next Friday)? 
\\
To work on the project workflow and getting the equations set up and tested starting from Newton's law of Gravitation.
       
   \vfill

    \item What were (are) the difficulties/obstacles you faced (facing)?
\\
The main difficulty is coming up with a good workflow and setting up the equations as of now.         
\vfill

    \item What is the approximate percentage progress?
\\ 5\%

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Did you meet with your advisor(s) to discuss research this week?
\\
Yes. I did meet with Dr.Gowtham at 10:10 AM Wed, Nov 9 and 7:30 AM Thur, Nov 10 and was briefed and handed information on setting up the HPC cluster and have been in touch with Dr.Gowtham via email about the same.
          \vfill

    \item What did you do this week (past Saturday through this Friday)? 
\\
Worked on setting up the HPC cluster using the detailed description from Dr.Gowtham and also learnt how to run MATLAB remotely on parallel processors in-class discussions, Scientific computing 1, Thur, Nov 10 that will be used to complete the project. 
\vfill  
  \item What are you planning on doing next week (this Saturday through next Friday)? 
\\
Will try to implement the algorithm on MATLAB and to implement the algorithm parallely and set up workflow for running it on the cluster.
\vfill
    \item What were (are) the difficulties/obstacles you faced (facing)?
\\
Installing the nodes of the cluster took about a day although successful and some nodes gave trouble booting from the network but were resolved and installed.
\vfill  
  \item What is the approximate percentage progress?
\\
25\%.

    \item Did you meet with your advisor(s) to discuss research this week?
\\ No. Dr.Gowtham is not available on campus until next week.    
\vfill

    \item What did you do this week (past Saturday through this Friday)?
\\ Worked on the equations that pave way to implement the code on MATLAB. Studied Range-Kutta(RK4) technique to solve the problem.
\vfill 
    \item What are you planning on doing next week (this Saturday through next Friday)? 
\\Making sure the equations are feasible to code onto MATLAB.
Implement code on MATLAB locally and remotely. 
\vfill

    \item What were (are) the difficulties/obstacles you faced (facing)?
\\ Thorough understanding of the RK4 technique and how the project can be implemented using it.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Did you meet with your advisor(s) to discuss research this week?
\\ Yes. I did meet Dr.Gowtham on Nov 30, from 9:00 to 9:30 AM and Dr.Gowtham installed MATLAB on the cluster which is being used to run the Project.       
   \vfill

    \item What did you do this week (past Saturday through this Friday)? 
\\Worked rigourously on solving the problem on a 2D plane and coded it on MATLAB. The MATLAB code was run on the Cluster and the matrix generated for different velocities.           
\vfill

    \item What are you planning on doing next week (this Saturday through next Friday)? 
\\Get the results from the simulation and report the work to Dr.Gowtham.         
 \vfill

    \item What were (are) the difficulties/obstacles you faced (facing)?
\\{\tt{qsub}} is starting with at Error state {\tt{Eqw}} however, this shouldn't pose a problem as MATLAB is been running on the cluster using 4 {\tt{workers}} successfully and produced results. We will resolve the issue when we meet Dr.Gowtham next week.
