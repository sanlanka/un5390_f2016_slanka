# UN5390: Scientific Computing I        

Fall 2016             
Michigan Technological University        
Cross-listed as BE5390, EE5390 and MA5390              

## Instructor information           

Dr. Gowtham        
Director of Research Computing, IT            
Adj. Asst. Professor, Physics/ECE                    
Michigan Technological University               

## Course objectives            

 01. To gain an exposure to Linux command line, shell scripting, Git
     revision control system, and free/open source tools and utilities to
     design and develop computational workflows

 02. To acquire/enhance good programming and communication etiquette with
     an emphasis on readability and clarity of written code

 03. To translate science and engineering problems into computer programs,
     learn compilation, debugging and profiling techniques, and
     understand various sources of error

 04. To learn parallel programming techniques using OpenMP, and
     data visualization

 05. To learn about the use of hardware accelerators (time permitting)

## General guidelines           

 01. Show up on time. If the door is closed, stay out and do not bother
     coming in

 02. Show up prepared, and in a presentable and professional manner. You
     might be randomly picked on any given day to lead a problem-solving
     process in front of the class

 03. No
     drinking,
     eating,
     facebooking,
     gaming,
     instagramming,
     sleeping,
     snapchatting,
     texting,
     tweeting,
     etc., during class. Cell phones must be in silent mode as well        


 04. Course material and assignments will be distributed, and assignments
     and project work must be submitted via
     [GitHub](http://github.com/ "GitHub"). You may turn in partially completed
     assignments, without the fear of penalty even if you believe the
     solution is incorrect, to show timely and continuous work. You may
     incorporate my suggestions, if any, into your assignment and turn it
     in for grading. Late submissions will not be accepted.

     There are no restrictions on programming languages. You can use any
     language, more than one if necessary, for this course. The choice of
     languages should be guided by their applicability to your research
     endeavors, and their potential for parallelization. You are responsible 
     for learning the language including its features and caveats.

     It is expected that you will work on the assignment consistently from
     the day it's handed out. If you have any questions, concerns and/or
     need further information, you must get in touch with the instructor at
     least 48 hours before it's due. Use an method [in person (on/off
     campus), email (with ```UN5390:``` or ```BE5390:``` or
     ```EE5390:``` or ```MA5390:``` in the subject field), phone call,
     etc.] that works for you to do so.

     Assignments and project reports must be typeset in LaTeX using the
     provided template. Microsoft Word, Notepad, handwritten notes, etc. will 
     not be accepted. There is no need to explicitly include the code in the 
     ```.tex``` document.

     It is acceptable (and often highly encouraged) to seek help from your
     classmates and/or others but any such help must be clearly and
     appropriately cited in the assignment. If you helped someone, you must
     include that information as well. Absence of proper citation and/or
     inability to explain your work will mean that someone else authored it.
     This, in turn, means that you will get no credit for the problem and
     the incident will be treated as a case of academic dishonesty.

     Submissions must be thoroughly spell-checked for typographical and/or
     grammatical mistakes. If the submissions contain such mistakes or be
     otherwise deemed difficult to understand, you will be required to work
     with the
     [Michigan Tech Multiliteracies Center](http://www.mtu.edu/humanities/resources/mtmc/ "Michigan Tech Multiliteracies Center")
