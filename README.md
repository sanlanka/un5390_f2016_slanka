Fall 2016             
Michigan Technological University        
Cross-listed as BE5390, EE5390 and MA5390              

## Instructor information           

Dr. Gowtham        
Director of Research Computing, IT            
Adj. Asst. Professor, Physics/ECE                    
Michigan Technological University               

## Course objectives            

  1. Exposure to Linux command line, shell scripting, revision control 
     system, and several free and open source tools and utilities to aid 
     in design and development of computational workflows

  2. Acquire/Enhance good programming and communication etiquette with an 
     emphasis on readability and clarity of written code

  3. Translate science and engineering problems into computer programs in a 
     language of student's choice

  4. Learn compilation, debugging and profiling techniques

  5. Understand and troubleshoot the (sources of) errors in such programs


## General guidelines           

 01. Show up on time. If the door is closed, stay out and do not bother
     coming in.

 02. No eating, drinking, sleeping, facebooking, tweeting, instagramming,
     gaming, etc. during class. Cell phones must be in silent mode as well.

 03. There are no restrictions on programming languages. You can use one
     (or more) -- preferably the ones most useful for your research. However,
     you are responsible for learning the language including its features and
     caveats.

 04. Course material and assignments will be distributed via
     [GitHub](http://github.com/ "GitHub").

 05. Assignments must be submitted electronically via
     [GitHub](http://github.com/ "GitHub"). You may turn in partially completed
     assignments, without the fear of penalty even if you believe the solution
     is incorrect, to show timely and continuous work. You may incorporate my
     suggestions, if any, into your assignment and turn it in as final
     submission for grading. 

     Late submissions will not be accepted. 

 06. It is expected that you will work on the assignment consistently from
     the day it's handed out. If you have any questions, concerns and/or
     need further information, you must get in touch with the instructor at 
     least 48 hours before it's due. Any method [in person (on/off campus),
     email (with ```UN5390:``` or ```BE5390:``` or ```EE5390:``` or 
     ```MA5390:```  in the subject field), phone call, etc.] that works 
     for you will work for the instructor.

 07. Assignments and project reports must be typeset in LaTeX using the
     provided template. Microsoft Word, Notepad, hand-written notes, etc. 
     will not be accepted.

     There is no need to explicitly include the code in the ```.tex```
     document. 

 08. It is acceptable (and often highly encouraged) to seek help from your 
     classmates and/or others but any such help must be clearly and 
     appropriately cited in the assignment. If you helped someone, you must 
     include that information as well.

     Absence of proper citation and/or inability to explain the code you
     have written will mean that someone else authored your work. This,
     in turn, means that you will get no credit for the problem
     and the incident will be treated as a case of academic dishonesty.

 09. Submissions must be thoroughly spell-checked for typographical and/or 
     grammatical mistakes. If the submissions contain such mistakes or be
     otherwise deemed difficult to understand, you will be required to work 
     with the
     [Michigan Tech Multiliteracies Center](http://www.mtu.edu/humanities/resources/mtmc/ "Michigan Tech Multiliteracies Center").       

 10. Academic policies: [http://www.mtu.edu/deanofstudents/academic-policies/](http://www.mtu.edu/deanofstudents/academic-policies/ "http://www.mtu.edu/deanofstudents/academic-policies/").
